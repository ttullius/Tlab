Typical analyses treat DNA sequences merely as strings of letters, without considering the effect of nucleotide sequence on local DNA structure. Recent work demonstrating that many DNA binding proteins exploit subtle differences in minor groove shape (and the accompanying variation in electrostatic potential) for recognition and binding provides compelling motivation for considering DNA shape in the analysis of protein binding sites in the human genome. 

The Tullius lab has developed a structural method that is well suited for this aim. This method takes advantage of the sensitivity of the hydroxyl radical to local DNA structure. The hydroxyl radical, an extremely reactive free radical, attacks deoxyribose residues in DNA and cleaves the DNA backbone at the site of reaction. The Tullius lab has shown that the extent of cleavage of a given nucleotide in duplex DNA depends on the solvent-accessible surface area of that nucleotide. Thus the cleavage pattern represents a topographical map of the shape of the surface of a DNA molecule. This chemical probe method is ideal for the purpose of characterizing the structures of DNA sequences in solution.

In previous work the Tullius lab constructed a database of experimentally determined hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns, called ORChID (OH Radical Cleavage Intensity Database), to survey the sequence-dependent structure of DNA. We used ORChID to show that DNA structure is subject to evolutionary selection. We are now developing a high-throughput experimental platform, incorporating laboratory robotics and capillary electrophoresis, to greatly increase the number of sequences in ORChID. The Tullius lab recently published a new method, called ORChID2, based on hydroxyl radical cleavage, that directly maps the shape and electrostatic potential of the DNA minor groove at single nucleotide resolution.

In a collaboration with Remo Rohs and his group at USC, the Tullius lab is experimentally characterizing the structures of DNA sequences for which structural features have been predicted using a high-throughput Monte Carlo algorithm. To do this, we use our high-throughput robotics/capillary electrophoresis platform to measure the hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns of these DNA sequences. The structural details that emerge from ORChID1 and ORChID2 analyses will be used as constraints to drive the Monte Carlo-based simulation of DNA structure. The synergism of computation and experiment is a hallmark of this project, and distinguishes it from other approaches.
