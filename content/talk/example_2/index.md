abstract: This presentation focuses on the question of whether DNA-binding proteins recognize intrinsic structural features in DNA (DNA shape), or whether protein binding induces changes in DNA structure. This is a surprisingly tricky question to answer experimentally. While many X-ray crystal structures of protein-DNA complexes are available, there are almost no X-ray structures of the cognate naked DNA containing the protein binding site. We developed an experimental approach to this question, in which the chemical probe hydroxyl radical is used to make a nucleotide-resolution map of minor groove shape in a naked DNA molecule. Comparison of this pattern with the pattern of minor groove shape in the X-ray structure of the corresponding protein-DNA complex directly shows whether the minor groove width pattern of naked DNA persists in the complex, or whether protein binding changes the pattern. Since regions of narrow minor groove width often are associated with specific electrostatic interactions between protein and DNA, this approach can illuminate modes of DNA recognition by protein. We used capillary electrophoresis to analyze hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns of 11 protein binding sites. For 7 sites, regions of narrow minor groove width found in the naked DNA persisted in the protein-DNA complex, and were found to interact electrostatically with arginine residues from the protein. In 4 sites, protein binding remodeled the structure of the naked DNA, leading to a different pattern of minor groove width in the complex. The experimental workflow introduced here provides a new and quantitative way to compare the shape of naked DNA with the shape of DNA in a protein-DNA complex. Capillary electrophoresis provides at best medium experimental throughput, though. We now use Illumina DNA sequencing to make this experimental method for mapping DNA structure into a high-throughput technique, with potential to make structural maps of large stretches of naked genomic DNA in context.
