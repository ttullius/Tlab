Tom Tullius is [Professor of Chemistry](http://www.bu.edu/chemistry/faculty/tullius/) and Director of the [Graduate Program in Bioinformatics](http://www.bu.edu/bioinformatics/) at Boston University. He received his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1979 in bioinorganic chemistry, working with [Keith O. Hodgson](https://chemistry.stanford.edu/people/keith-hodgson) on X-ray spectroscopy of metalloproteins. He was an NIH postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University from 1979-1982 in the laboratory of [Stephen J. Lippard](http://lippardlab.mit.edu), studying the interaction of platinum antitumor drugs with DNA. He began his independent academic career in 1982 at The Johns Hopkins University, where he was Professor of Chemistry, Biophysics, and Biology and the McCollum-Pratt Institute. He moved to Boston University in 1997 to become Chair of the Department of Chemistry (1997-2005). His awards include an Ellison Medical Foundation Senior Scholar Award in Aging, the Herbert A. Sober Award of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and a Searle Scholar award. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 

Tom Tullius is widely known for introducing a powerful chemistry-based method, hydroxyl radical footprinting, for determining structural details of nucleic acids. Systems his laboratory has studied include the nucleosome, the Holliday junction recombination intermediate, bent DNA, and a wide variety of DNA-protein complexes. Tullius lab publications have been very highly cited – five key papers have been cited in more than 2000 scientific papers. Hydroxyl radical footprinting has been adopted by many scientists in related fields, to determine the structures of large RNAs and to follow the kinetics of folding of RNA. In recent years the Tullius laboratory has focused on studies at the whole-genome level. As part of the ENCODE Consortium, the Tullius lab used the hydroxyl radical method to make a high-resolution structural map of the human genome. The lab’s most exciting recent finding is that there is evolutionary selection for DNA shape that is not evident in the conservation of nucleotide sequence. The new genomic "grammar" that the Tullius lab is beginning to describe has the promise to revolutionize our understanding of the role of DNA shape and structure in biology. 

Tom has been profiled by [The Scientist](https://www.the-scientist.com/uncategorized/radical-thinking-43226).
