 abstract = {The DNA-binding domain of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 was found by hydroxyl radical footprinting to protect backbone positions on one side of its DNA-binding site. The guanines contacted in the major groove by the DNA-binding domain of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 were identified by methylation protection. No difference was found in the interaction of the DNA-binding domain of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 with tandemly repeated and overlapping binding sites.},
