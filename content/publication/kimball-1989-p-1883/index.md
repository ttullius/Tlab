abstract: The DNA-binding domain of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 was found
  by hydroxyl radical footprinting to protect backbone positions on one side of its
  DNA-binding site. The guanines contacted in the major groove by the DNA-binding
  domain of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 were identified by methylation protection.
  No difference was found in the interaction of the DNA-binding domain of Epstein-Barr
  virus nuclear antigen 1 with tandemly repeated and overlapping binding sites.
