abstract: Despite extensive study, there is little experimental information available
  as to which of the deoxyribose hydrogen atoms of duplex DNA reacts most with the
  hydroxyl radical. To investigate this question, we prepared a set of double-stranded
  DNA molecules in which deuterium had been incorporated specifically at each position
  in the deoxyribose of one of the four nucleotides. We then measured deuterium kinetic
  isotope effects on the rate of cleavage of DNA by the hydroxyl radical. These experiments
  demonstrate that the hydroxyl radical reacts with the various hydrogen atoms of
  the deoxyribose in the order 5′ H > 4′ H > 3′ H ≈ 2′ H ≈ 1′ H. This order of reactivity
  parallels the exposure to solvent of the deoxyribose hydrogens. Our work therefore
  reveals the structural basis of the reaction of the hydroxyl radical with DNA. These
  results also provide information on the mechanism of DNA damage caused by ionizing
  radiation as well as atomic-level detail for the interpretation of hydroxyl radical
  footprints of DNA-protein complexes and chemical probe experiments on the structure
  of RNA and DNA in solution.
