abstract: ' Background: Integrase mediates a crucial step in the life cycle of the
  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The enzyme cleaves the viral DNA ends in a sequence-dependent
  manner and couples the newly generated hydroxyl groups to phosphates in the target
  DNA. Three domains have been identified in HIV integrase: an amino-terminal domain,
  a central catalytic core and a carboxy-terminal DNA-binding domain. The amino-terminal
  region is the only domain with unknown structure thus far. This domain, which is
  known to bind zinc, contains a HHCC motif that is conserved in retroviral integrases.
  Although the exact function of this domain is unknown, it is required for cleavage
  and integration. Results: The three-dimensional structure of the amino-terminal
  domain of HIV-2 integrase has been determined using two-dimensional and three-dimensional
  nuclear magnetic resonance data. We obtained 20 final structures, calculated using
  693 nuclear Overhauser effects, which display a backbone root-mean square deviation
  versus the average of 0.25 Å for the well defined region. The structure consists
  of three α helices and a helical turn. The zinc is coordinated with His 12 via the
  Nϵ2 atom, with His 16 via the N δ1 atom and with the sulfur atoms of Cys40 and Cys43.
  The α helices form a three-helix bundle that is stabilized by this zinc-binding
  unit. The helical arrangement is similar to that found in the DNA-binding domains
  of the trp repressor, the prd paired domain and Tc3A transposase. Conclusion: The
  amino-terminal domain of HIV-2 integrase has a remarkable hybrid structure combining
  features of a three-helix bundle fold with a zinc-binding HHCC motif. This structure
  shows no similarity with any of the known zinc-finger structures. The strictly conserved
  residues of the HHCC motif of retroviral integrases are involved in metal coordination,
  whereas many other well conserved hydrophobic residues are part of the protein core.'
