 abstract = {Hydroxyl radical footprinting is a widely used method for following the folding of RNA molecules in solution. This method has the unique ability to provide experimental information on the solvent accessibility of each nucleotide in an RNA molecule, so that the folding of all domains of the RNA species can be followed simultaneously at single-nucleotide resolution. In recent work, hydroxyl radical footprinting has been used, often in combination with other global measures of structure, to work out detailed folding pathways and three-dimensional structures for increasingly large and complicated RNA molecules. These include synthetic ribozymes, and group I and group II ribozymes, from yeast, the Azoarcus cyanobacterium and Tetrahymena thermophila. Advances have been made in methods for analysis of hydroxyl radical data, so that the large datasets that result from kinetic folding experiments can be analyzed in a semi-automated and quantitative manner.},
