abstract: Hydroxyl radical footprinting is a widely used method for following the
  folding of RNA molecules in solution. This method has the unique ability to provide
  experimental information on the solvent accessibility of each nucleotide in an RNA
  molecule, so that the folding of all domains of the RNA species can be followed
  simultaneously at single-nucleotide resolution. In recent work, hydroxyl radical
  footprinting has been used, often in combination with other global measures of structure,
  to work out detailed folding pathways and three-dimensional structures for increasingly
  large and complicated RNA molecules. These include synthetic ribozymes, and group
  I and group II ribozymes, from yeast, the Azoarcus cyanobacterium and Tetrahymena
  thermophila. Advances have been made in methods for analysis of hydroxyl radical
  data, so that the large datasets that result from kinetic folding experiments can
  be analyzed in a semi-automated and quantitative manner.
