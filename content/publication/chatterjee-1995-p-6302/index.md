abstract: Calicheamicin yl' (CLMyl') is one of the diynene antitumor antibiotics known
  to show comparatively high sequence selectivity in its cleavages of DNA. The origins
  of this discrimination and the proposed role of the side-chain aryl iodide interaction
  with the helix are addressed. While drug activation with thiols is complex, the
  rate-limiting rearrangement of the dihydrothiophene intermediate in this process
  is sufficiently slow for it to serve as the species responsible for the sequence
  selection common to all reaction pathways leading to DNA cleavage. Internal competition
  experiments between a TCCT-AGGA sequence, known to be favorable for selective cutting,
  and a series of other cleavage sites of equal size have been conducted with the
  dihydrothiophene. Although the extents of reaction differ at the variable four-base
  pair cassette, the rates of reaction are identical within experimental error. These
  results indicate that equilibrium binding of the dihydrothiophene is achieved before
  substantial strand scission has taken place. Therefore, kinetic effects owing, for
  example, to steric compression to enhance the rate of Bergman cyclization at certain
  sites do not occur. Sequence selection is govemed by thermodynamic effects favoring
  binding of the dihydrothiophene at these sequences. Free energy differences relative
  to the TCCT site can, therefore, be calculated. Knowing this, inosine (I) substitutions
  for guanosine have been made within the complementary AGGA to give AIGA and AGIA
  to examine the effect of replacing the 2-amino group of guanosine with the hydrogen
  of inosine. Analogous competition experiments permit the thermodynamic advantage
  conferred by aryl iodide interaction with the 5'-guanosine to be estimated as approximately
  1 kcaYmo1. The magnitude of this stabilization was compared to the total binding
  of CLMyl' and CLME at a TCCT-AGGA sequence by isothermal titration calorimetry and
  quantitative hydroxyl radical footprint titration, respectively, to give an overall
  view of the energetics of calicheamicin binding to DNA and the role played by the
  side-chain aryl iodide.
