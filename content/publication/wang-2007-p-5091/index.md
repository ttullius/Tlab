abstract: Using singly gapped or nicked templates containing the T7A1 promoter, we
  have measured several kinetic parameters related to the process of transcription
  initiation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, confirming and extending previous
  results using a population of randomly gapped templates. A reduced probability of
  transcript abortion at RNA lengths of 6 and 7 nucleotides and a lower ratio of abortive
  to productive initiation events was observed for some discontinuous templates, consistent
  with models attributing abortive initiation to the accumulation of strain in the
  initiating complex. The effect of DNA discontinuity on abortion of shorter RNA transcripts
  (2-3 nucleotides) was less pronounced; abortion at these short chain lengths may
  primarily be attributed to the low stability of the RNA-DNA hybrid. Certain discontinuities
  had significant effects on the intrinsic catalytic capacity of the open complex
  and also on the partitioning between productive and unproductive complexes, suggesting
  that subtle changes in the conformation of the open complex can profoundly affect
  its function. The rate and efficiency of promoter escape were not correlated with
  the stability of the open promoter complex despite previous suggestions to the contrary.
  We conclude that the stability of the open promoter complex is only one of several
  factors that contribute to the overall rate of promoter escape.
