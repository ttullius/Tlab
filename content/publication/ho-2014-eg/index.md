abstract: Genome function is dynamically regulated in part by chromatin, which consists
  of the histones, non-histone proteins and RNA molecules that package DNA. Studies
  in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have contributed substantially
  to our understanding of molecular mechanisms of genome function in humans, and have
  revealed conservation of chromatin components and mechanisms. Nevertheless, the
  three organisms have markedly different genome sizes, chromosome architecture and
  gene organization. On human and fly chromosomes, for example, pericentric heterochromatin
  flanks single centromeres, whereas worm chromosomes have dispersed heterochromatin-like
  regions enriched in the distal chromosomal 'arms', and centromeres distributed along
  their lengths. To systematically investigate chromatin organization and associated
  gene regulation across species, we generated and analysed a large collection of
  genome-wide chromatin data sets from cell lines and developmental stages in worm,
  fly and human. Here we present over 800 new data sets from our ENCODE and modENCODE
  consortia, bringing the total to over 1,400. Comparison of combinatorial patterns
  of histone modifications, nuclear lamina-associated domains, organization of large-scale
  topological domains, chromatin environment at promoters and enhancers, nucleosome
  positioning, and DNA replication patterns reveals many conserved features of chromatin
  organization among the three organisms. We also find notable differences in the
  composition and locations of repressive chromatin. These data sets and analyses
  provide a rich resource for comparative and species-specific investigations of chromatin
  composition, organization and function.
