abstract: Exonuclease III has been shown previously to reveal the binding sites of
  the antitumor drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) on DNA. Pretreatment of the
  same DNA with the intercalator ethidium bromide causes new platinum binding sites
  to be detected by the exonuclease III method. In particular, a 5'd(G6-D-G2)3' sequence
  in a 165-base-pair restriction fragment of plasmid pBR322 becomes a preferred site
  for exonuclease III-detectable cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)binding. This switching
  of nuclease-sensitive platinum binding to new sites by the influence of another
  drug, ethidium bromide, offers an explantation at the molecular level for the phenomenon
  of synergism in combination chemotherapy.
