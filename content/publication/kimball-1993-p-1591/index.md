abstract: Hydrogen peroxide is capable of effecting the cleavage of a specific phosphodiester
  bond in DNA, when used in concert with the recombinase enzyme Flp from Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae. This cleavage is not caused by oxidative damage of the DNA backbone
  but instead is the result of nucleophilic attack by peroxide. A single phosphorus-oxygen
  bond is broken in the reaction. Cleavage of DNA by peroxide also occurs with an
  inactive mutant of Flp in which the active site nucleophile tyrosine has been replaced
  by phenylalanine. Besides providing information on the mechanism of strand cleavage
  by Flp, these results may contribute to the development of new synthetic DNA cleavage
  reagents that act by hydrolytic and not radical chemistry.
