abstract: Mac1 is a metalloregulatory protein that regulates expression of the high
  affinity copper transport system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Under conditions
  of high copper concentration, Mac1 represses transcription of genes coding for copper
  transport proteins. Mac1 binds to DNA sequences called copper response elements
  (CuREs), which have the consensus sequence 5'-TTTGC(T/G)C(A/G)-3'. Mac1 contains
  two zinc binding sites, a copper binding site, and the sequence motif RGRP, which
  has been found in other proteins to mediate binding to the minor groove of A/T-rich
  sequences in DNA. We have used hydroxyl radical footprinting, missing nucleoside,
  and methylation interference experiments to investigate the structure of the complex
  of the DNA binding domain of Mac1 (called here Mac1(t)) with the two CuRE sites
  found in the yeast CTR1 promoter. We conclude from these experiments that Mac1(t)
  binds in a modular fashion to DNA, with its RGRP AT-hook motif interacting with
  the TTT sequence at the 5' end of the CTR1 CuRE site, and with another DNA-binding
  module(s) binding in the adjacent major groove in the GCTCA sequence.
