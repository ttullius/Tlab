abstract: Runs of adenines (adenine tracts) have been implicated as the main determinant
  of sequence-directed DNA bending. The most widely used experimental test for bending
  relies on the observation that bent DNA migrates more slowly than straight DNA on
  a polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. It was shown recently that the polymer (GTTTTAAAAC)n
  runs with normal mobility on a gel, whereas (GAAAATTTTC)n runs more slowly and thus
  appears to be strongly bent. The observation that these similar sequences, which
  differ only in the order of the adenine and thymine tracts, adopt such different
  shapes offers a stringent test of theories to explain DNA bending. Although the
  wedge model for DNA bending has recently been elaborated to explain the gel mobilities
  of these molecules, we wished to determine experimentally the structural basis for
  the difference in bending. We report here measurements of the frequency of cleavage
  by the hydroxyl radical at each nucleotide of cloned versions of the two polymers
  (see Fig. 1). We show that the TTTTAAAA sequence does not display the cleavage pattern
  that is associated with bent DNA, whereas the AAAATTTT sequence does. The observed
  sequence dependence of the cleavage pattern of an adenine tract is at odds with
  current models for DNA bending, which assume that adenine tracts always adopt the
  same conformation.
