abstract: We have used hydroxyl radical cleavage of DNA to probe the organization
  of the nucleosome core at high salt concentration and high temperature. The rotational
  and translational positioning of a DNA fragment, containing part of the Xenopus
  borealis 5S RNA gene, on the histone octamer is maintained between salt concentrations
  of 0.0 and 0.8 M NaCl and between temperatures of 0 and 75 degrees C. These results
  provide evidence that the energy of bending DNA around the nucleosome is independent
  of salt concentration and temperature in this range. They illustrate the severe
  energetic requirements necessary to displace DNA from previously organized contacts
  with histones in the nucleosome core.
