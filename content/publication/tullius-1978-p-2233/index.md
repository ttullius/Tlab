abstract: The primary coordination environment of the “blue” copper ion in oxidized
  azurin has been elucidated by x-ray absorption spectroscopy. The most striking feature
  is the unambiguous presence of a very short copper-sulfur distance at 2.10 ± 0.02
  Å. Nitrogen ligands, presumed to be from imidazoles, are found at 1.97 Å. There
  is some evidence that the copper coordination sphere may be completed by a second
  sulfur, the distance of which is determined with much less certainty.
