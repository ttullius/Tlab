abstract: Many regulatory mechanisms require a high degree of specificity in protein-DNA
  binding. Nucleotide sequence does not provide an answer to the question of why a
  protein binds only to a small subset of the many putative binding sites in the genome
  that share the same core motif. Whereas higher-order effects, such as chromatin
  accessibility, cooperativity and cofactors, have been described, DNA shape recently
  gained attention as another feature that fine-tunes the DNA binding specificities
  of some transcription factor families. Our Genome Browser for DNA shape annotations
  (GBshape; freely available at http://rohslab.cmb.usc.edu/GBshape/) provides minor
  groove width, propeller twist, roll, helix twist and hydroxyl radical cleavage predictions
  for the entire genomes of 94 organisms. Additional genomes can easily be added using
  the GBshape framework. GBshape can be used to visualize DNA shape annotations qualitatively
  in a genome browser track format, and to download quantitative values of DNA shape
  features as a function of genomic position at nucleotide resolution. As biological
  applications, we illustrate the periodicity of DNA shape features that are present
  in nucleosome-occupied sequences from human, fly and worm, and we demonstrate structural
  similarities between transcription start sites in the genomes of four Drosophila
  species.
