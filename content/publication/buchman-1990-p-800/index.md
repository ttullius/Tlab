abstract: CUP2 is a copper-dependent transcriptional activator of the yeast CUP1 metallothionein
  gene. In the presence of Cu+ and Ag+) ions its DNA-binding domain is thought to
  fold as a cysteine-coordinated Cu cluster which recognizes the palindromic CUP1
  upstream activation sequence (UASc). Using mobility shift, methylation interference,
  and DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting assays, we examined the interaction
  of wild-type and variant CUP2 proteins produced in Escherichia coli with the UASc.
  Our results suggest that CUP2 has a complex Cu-coordinated DNA-binding domain containing
  different parts that function as DNA-binding elements recognizing distinct sequence
  motifs embedded within the UASc. A single-amino-acid substitution of cysteine 11
  with a tyrosine results in decreased Cu binding, apparent inactivation of one of
  the DNA-binding elements and a dramatic change in the recognition properties of
  CUP2. This variant protein interacts with only one part of the wild-type site and
  prefers to bind to a different half-site from the wild-type protein. Although the
  variant has about 10% of wild-type DNA-binding activity, it appears to be completely
  incapable of activating transcription.
