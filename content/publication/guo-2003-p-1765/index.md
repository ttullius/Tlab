abstract: Ionizing radiation damages DNA in several ways, including through formation
  of a single-nucleoside gap in one DNA strand. We have developed a two-dimensional
  gel electrophoresis method to investigate the effect of a strand gap on DNA structure.
  We generate a library of gapped DNA molecules by treating a DNA restriction fragment
  with the hydroxyl radical, generated by the reaction of Fe(II) EDTA with hydrogen
  peroxide. The DNA molecule studied contains a fixed bend produced by a set of phased
  adenine tracts. The A-tract bend serves as a reference bend for investigating the
  conformational nature of a strand gap. In the first electrophoretic dimension, a
  bent DNA molecule that has been treated with the hydroxyl radical is electrophoresed
  on a native gel. Smearing of the band on the native gel indicates that the library
  of gapped DNA molecules contains a variety of DNA conformations. In the second electrophoretic
  dimension, gapped DNA molecules having different native gel mobilities are electrophoresed
  on separate lanes of a denaturing gel to reveal how each strand gap affects the
  native gel mobility (and thus shape) of the DNA. Our results demonstrate that a
  single-nucleoside gap in a DNA duplex leads to an anisotropic, directional bend
  in the DNA helix axis. The implications of our findings for recognition of this
  lesion by DNA repair proteins are discussed.
