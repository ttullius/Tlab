abstract: We report the use of hydroxyl radical footprinting to analyze the interaction
  of distamycin and actinomycin with the 5S ribosomal RNA genes of Xenopus. There
  is a qualitative difference in the hydroxyl radical footprints of the two drugs.
  Distamycin gives a conventional (albeit high-resolution) footprint, while actinomycin
  does not protect DNA from hydroxyl radical attack, but instead induces discrete
  sites of hyperreactivity. We find concentration-dependent changes in the locations
  of distamycin binding sites on the somatic 5S gene of Xenopus borealis. A high-affinity
  site, containing a G.C base pair, is replaced at higher levels of bound drug by
  a periodic array of different lower affinity sites that coincide with the places
  where the minor groove of the DNA would face in toward a nucleosome core that is
  known to bind to the same sequence. These results suggest that distamycin recognizes
  potential binding sites more by the shape of the DNA than by the specific sequence
  that is contained in the site and that structures of many sequences are deformable
  to a shape that allows drug binding. We discuss the utility of hydroxyl radical
  footprinting of distamycin for investigating the underlying structure of DNA.
