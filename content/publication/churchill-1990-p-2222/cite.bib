 abstract = {We report the use of hydroxyl radical footprinting to analyze the interaction of distamycin and actinomycin with the 5S ribosomal RNA genes of Xenopus. There is a qualitative difference in the hydroxyl radical footprints of the two drugs. Distamycin gives a conventional (albeit high-resolution) footprint, while actinomycin does not protect DNA from hydroxyl radical attack, but instead induces discrete sites of hyperreactivity. We find concentration-dependent changes in the locations of distamycin binding sites on the somatic 5S gene of Xenopus borealis. A high-affinity site, containing a G.C base pair, is replaced at higher levels of bound drug by a periodic array of different lower affinity sites that coincide with the places where the minor groove of the DNA would face in toward a nucleosome core that is known to bind to the same sequence. These results suggest that distamycin recognizes potential binding sites more by the shape of the DNA than by the specific sequence that is contained in the site and that structures of many sequences are deformable to a shape that allows drug binding. We discuss the utility of hydroxyl radical footprinting of distamycin for investigating the underlying structure of DNA.},
