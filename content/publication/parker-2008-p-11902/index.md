abstract: GC content has been shown to be an important aspect of human genomic function.  Extending  beyond
  the scope of GC content alone, there is a class of regions in the genome that have
  especially  high GC content and are enriched for the CG dinucleotideâ€”called CpG
  islands.  CpG islands have  been linked to biologically functional genomic elements.  DNA
  structure also contributes to  biological function.  Recent studies found that some
  DNA structural properties are correlated with  CpG island functionality [5, 14].  Here,
  we use hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns as a measure of  DNA structure, to explore
  the relationship between GC content and fine-scale DNA structure.  We  show that
  there is a positive correlation between GC content and the solvent-accessible structural  properties
  of a DNA sequence, and that the strength of this correlation decreases as genomic  resolution
  increases. We demonstrate that regions of the genome that have highly solvent-accessible  DNA
  structure tend to overlap functional genomic elements.  Our results suggest that
  fine-scale  DNA structural properties that are encoded in the genome are important
  for biological function, and  that the highly solvent-accessible nature of high
  GC content regions and some CpG islands may  account for some of their functional
  properties.
