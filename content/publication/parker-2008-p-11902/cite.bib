 abstract = {GC content has been shown to be an important aspect of human genomic function.  Extending  beyond the scope of GC content alone, there is a class of regions in the genome that have especially  high GC content and are enriched for the CG dinucleotideâ€”called CpG islands.  CpG islands have  been linked to biologically functional genomic elements.  DNA structure also contributes to  biological function.  Recent studies found that some DNA structural properties are correlated with  CpG island functionality [5, 14].  Here, we use hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns as a measure of  DNA structure, to explore the relationship between GC content and fine-scale DNA structure.  We  show that there is a positive correlation between GC content and the solvent-accessible structural  properties of a DNA sequence, and that the strength of this correlation decreases as genomic  resolution increases. We demonstrate that regions of the genome that have highly solvent-accessible  DNA structure tend to overlap functional genomic elements.  Our results suggest that fine-scale  DNA structural properties that are encoded in the genome are important for biological function, and  that the highly solvent-accessible nature of high GC content regions and some CpG islands may  account for some of their functional properties.},
