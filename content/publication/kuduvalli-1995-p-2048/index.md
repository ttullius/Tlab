abstract: The cleavage by calicheamicin gamma 1I (CLM gamma 1I) of a nucleosome formed
  on the 5S RNA gene of Xenopus borealis was studied in vitro as a first step toward
  the understanding of CLM gamma 1I-chromatin interactions within the cell. The drug
  does not cleave in the region of the dyad axis of the nucleosome. Outside of this
  region, double-stranded cleavage occurs with a periodicity of 10-11 bp. The sites
  of cleavage correspond to DNA sequences facing outward in the nucleosome. The drug
  shows some sequence preference of cleavage within these accessible sites. The predominant
  cleavage event within this nucleosome occurs at -1 helical turn from the dyad axis.
  This site constitutes a \"hot spot\" for CLM gamma 1I cleavage within the 5S nucleosome.
  We observe an overall footprinting effect whereby the drug preferentially cleaves
  DNA located outside the nucleosome core (analogous to the linker DNA of chromatin)
  as compared to cleavage within the nucleosome core. We discuss the importance of
  accessibility, structural deformations of DNA within the nucleosome, and steric
  constraints posed by sequence, in the recognition and cleavage of nucleosomal DNA
  by calicheamicin.
