abstract: Functional deletion mutants of the trans-acting factor TFIIIA, truncated
  at both ends of the molecule, have been expressed by in vitro transcription of a
  cDNA clone and subsequent cell-free translation of the synthetic mRNAs. A region
  of TFIIIA 19 amino acids or less, near the carboxyl terminus, is critical for maximal
  transcription and lies outside the DNA-binding domain. The elongated protein can
  be aligned over the internal control region (ICR) of the Xenopus 5S RNA gene with
  its carboxyl terminus oriented toward the 5' end of the gene and its amino terminus
  oriented toward the 3' end of the gene. The nine \"zinc fingers\" and the linkers
  that separate them comprise 80% of the protein mass and correspond to the DNA-binding
  domain of TFIIIA. The zinc fingers near the amino terminus of the protein contribute
  more to the overall binding energy of the protein to the ICR than do the zinc fingers
  near the carboxyl end. The most striking feature of TFIIIA is its modular structure.
  This is demonstrated by the fact that each zinc finger binds to just one of three
  short nucleotide sequences within the ICR.
