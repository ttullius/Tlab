 abstract = {The immediate coordination environment of vanadium in living ascidian blood cells (vanadocytes) has been studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Analysis of the X-ray absorption edge data shows clearly that only a small amount (less than 10%) of the vanadium is present as the V02+ ion in either living or spontaneously lysed vanadocytes. Parameters for curve-fitting analysis of V EXAFS were determined semiempirically from data on model complexes of known structure and 
have been tested for amplitude and phase transferability by using other structurally characterized V complexes. Analysis of the EXAFS data from the vanadocytes establishes that the vanadium in the living cells is present as V(II1) ions surrounded in the first coordination sphere by a symmetric, single shell of low-atomic-weight scatterers. The data are best fit by a single shell of six oxygen atoms at an average distance of 1.99 A. The EXAFS data show no evidence for the presence of V02+. 
Absence of a well-defined second shell of scatterers suggests that the vanadium complex in the living cells is simply aquo-vanadium(III), not associated with a ligand containing ordered, more distant shells (such as porphyrin or imidazole). Upon spontaneous lysis, little change in the vanadium coordination environment (as judged by the edge or EXAFS) is observed.},
