abstract: The immediate coordination environment of vanadium in living ascidian blood
  cells (vanadocytes) has been studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Analysis
  of the X-ray absorption edge data shows clearly that only a small amount (less than
  10%) of the vanadium is present as the V02+ ion in either living or spontaneously
  lysed vanadocytes. Parameters for curve-fitting analysis of V EXAFS were determined
  semiempirically from data on model complexes of known structure and  have been tested
  for amplitude and phase transferability by using other structurally characterized
  V complexes. Analysis of the EXAFS data from the vanadocytes establishes that the
  vanadium in the living cells is present as V(II1) ions surrounded in the first coordination
  sphere by a symmetric, single shell of low-atomic-weight scatterers. The data are
  best fit by a single shell of six oxygen atoms at an average distance of 1.99 A.
  The EXAFS data show no evidence for the presence of V02+.  Absence of a well-defined
  second shell of scatterers suggests that the vanadium complex in the living cells
  is simply aquo-vanadium(III), not associated with a ligand containing ordered, more
  distant shells (such as porphyrin or imidazole). Upon spontaneous lysis, little
  change in the vanadium coordination environment (as judged by the edge or EXAFS)
  is observed.
