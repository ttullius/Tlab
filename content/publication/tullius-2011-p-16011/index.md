abstract: In the age of genomics, DNA is depicted as a string of letters. While this
  s a useful device for representing the information in a genome, the molecular nature
  of DNA is obscured. Proteins cannot actually “read” DNA letters – they   discriminate
  between DNA binding sites via molecular recognition, which is  sensitive to DNA
  structure. Since shape is essential to DNA’s biological function, we hypothesized
  that natural selection can act to preserve DNA shape without  maintaining the exact
  sequence of nucleotides. To test this hypothesis, we developed a DNA structure database,
  ORChID, and used it to map structural variation throughout the human genome. We
  then devised a computational algorithm, Chai, to detect evolutionary constraint
  on DNA shape. We found that Chai regions correlate better with experimental functional
  elements than do genomic regions that are sequence-constrained. Our results support
  the hypothesis that DNA shape can be a substrate for natural selection.
