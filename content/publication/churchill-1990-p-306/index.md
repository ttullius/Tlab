abstract: The zinc finger protein TFIIIA, a positive transcription factor of the 5S
  RNA gene, binds to an internal control region of 50 nucleotides. Two modes of binding
  have been considered for the TFIIIA-DNA complex, one of which has been proposed
  on the basis of nuclease and chemical protection experiments and the other on model
  building. Since then, evidence has accumulated on the structures of individual components
  of the complex--for example, zinc finger polypeptides studied by NMR and a segment
  of the binding site analyzed by x-ray crystallography, but no high-resolution structural
  data on the TFIIIA-DNA complex itself are available. Probes used previously to study
  the TFIIIA-DNA complex do not react with every nucleotide of DNA, unlike hydroxyl
  radical, which cleaves DNA at every backbone position. We describe here the quantitative
  analysis of high-resolution hydroxyl radical footprints and suggest how the array
  of zinc fingers might interact with the double helix.
