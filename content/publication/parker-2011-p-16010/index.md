abstract: The rapidly increasing availability of DNA sequence data from modern high-throughput
  experimental techniques has created the need for computational algorithms to aid
  in motif discovery in genomic DNA. Such algorithms are typically used to find a
  statistical representation of the nucleotide sequence of the target site of a DNA-binding
  protein within a collection of DNA sequences that are thought to contain segments
  to which the protein is bound. A major assumption of these algorithms is that the
  protein recognizes the primary order of nucleotides in the sequence. However, proteins
  can also recognize the three-dimensional shape and structure of DNA. To account
  for this, we developed a computational method to predict the local structural profiles
  of any set of DNA sequences and then to search within these profiles for common
  DNA structural motifs. Here we describe the details of this method and use it to
  find a DNA structural motif in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast genome that is
  associated with binding of the transcription factor RLM1, a component of the protein
  kinase C-mediated MAP kinase pathway.
