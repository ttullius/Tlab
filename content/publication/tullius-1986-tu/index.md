abstract: A method has been developed for making \"footprints\" of proteins bound
  to DNA. The hydroxyl radical, generated by reduction of hydrogen peroxide by iron(II),
  is the reagent used to cut the DNA. Hydroxyl radical breaks the backbone of DNA
  with almost no sequence dependence, so all backbone positions may be monitored for
  contact with protein. In addition to defining the DNA sequence in contact with the
  protein, hydroxyl radical footprints embody structural information about the DNA-protein
  complex. For example, hydroxyl radical footprints of the bacteriophage lambda repressor
  and Cro protein show directly that these proteins are bound to only one side of
  the DNA helix. Additional contacts of lambda repressor and Cro protein with DNA,
  not observed by other chemical footprinting methods, are revealed by hydroxyl radical
  footprinting.
