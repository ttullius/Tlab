abstract: To determine the structural features responsible for the curvature of kinetoplast
  DNA, we studied 13 adenine tracts in Crithidia fasciculata kinetoplast DNA. The
  structures of the A tracts were analyzed by cutting the DNA with hydroxyl radical.
  Reactivity of hydroxyl radical toward the DNA backbone progressively decreased in
  the 5′→3′ direction of each A tract. The cutting pattern of the T-rich strand was
  offset by 1 or 2 bp from the pattern on the A-rich strand. An A tract in a restriction
  fragment from plasmid pBR322 had the same cutting pattern as the kinetoplast A tracts.
  We interpret these experiments to show that in A tracts the width of the minor groove
  decreases smoothly from the 5′→3′ end of the A tract.
