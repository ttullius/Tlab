abstract: The binding to DNA by calicheamicin epsilon (CLM epsilon), the rearranged
  and reduced product of the diynene antitumor antibiotic calicheamicin gamma 1I (CLM
  gamma 1I), was studied using the method of hydroxyl radical footprinting. The drug
  binding sites determined in this way were compared to locations of double-stranded
  DNA cleavage by thiol-activated CLM gamma 1I. The results of these experiments show
  that CLM epsilon lies in the minor groove in an extended conformation protecting
  approximately four nucleotides on each strand of DNA. Sites of CLM epsilon binding
  correlate to sites of CLM gamma 1I cleavage with protection by CLM epsilon occurring
  mainly to the 3' side of the site of C5' hydrogen abstraction. From these results,
  it is possible to propose global structures of the drug/DNA complexes such that
  the oligosaccharide side chain is arrayed to the 3' side of the site of C5' hydrogen
  abstraction. This conclusion is entirely consistent with the results of recent atom-transfer
  experiments [Hangeland, J.J., De Voss, J.J., Heath, J.A., Townsend, C.A., Ding,
  W.-D., Ashcroft, J., & Ellestad, G.A. (1992) Journal of the American Chemical Society
  114, 9200-9202]. Somewhat greater protection on the strand undergoing C5' hydrogen
  abstraction was observed to the 5' side of the site of attack owing presumably to
  proximity of the methyl carbamate portion of the drug with DNA. Overall, binding
  is seen where cleavage is seen in accord with thermodynamics of drug association
  to DNA being important in determining the sites of cleavage.
