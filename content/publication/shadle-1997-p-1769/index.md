abstract: A computer program, GelExplorer, which uses a new methodology for obtaining
  quantitative information about electrophoresis has been developed. It provides a
  straightforward, easy-to-use graphical interface, and includes a number of features
  which offer significant advantages over existing methods for quantitative gel analysis.
  The method uses curve fitting with a nonlinear least-squares optimization to deconvolute
  overlapping bands. Unlike most curve fitting approaches, the data is treated in
  two dimensions, fitting all the data across the entire width of the lane. This allows
  for accurate determination of the intensities of individual, overlapping bands,
  and in particular allows imperfectly shaped bands to be accurately modeled. Experiments
  described in this paper demonstrate empirically that the Lorentzian lineshape reproduces
  the contours of an individual gel band and provides a better model than the Gaussian
  function for curve fitting of electrophoresis bands. Results from several fitting
  applications are presented and a discussion of the sources and magnitudes of uncertainties
  in the results is included. Finally, the method is applied to the quantitative analysis
  of a hydroxyl radical footprint titration experiment to obtain the free energy of
  binding of the lambda repressor protein to the OR1 operator DNA sequence.
