abstract: Four-arm Holliday structures are ephemeral intermediates in genetic recombination.
  We have used an oligodeoxynucleotide system to form immobile DNA junctions, which
  are stable analogs of Holliday structures. We have probed the equilibrium structure
  of a junction by means of hydroxyl radicals generated by the reaction of iron(II)EDTA
  with hydrogen peroxide. The hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern shows twofold symmetry
  throughout the molecule. Strong protection from hydroxyl radical attack is evident
  on two strands near the branch site, and weaker protection may be seen four or five
  residues 3' to the branch site on the other two strands. No other position appears
  significantly distinct from double-helical DNA controls. From these data, we conclude
  that the Holliday junction is a twofold symmetric complex whose four arms form two
  stacking domains.
