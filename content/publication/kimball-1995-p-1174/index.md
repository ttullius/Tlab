abstract: The Flp protein catalyzes a site-specific recombination reaction between
  two 47 bp DNA sites without the assistance of any other protein or cofactor. The
  Flp recognition target (FRT) site consists of three nearly identical sequences,
  two of which are separated by an 8 bp spacer sequence. In order to gain insight
  into this remarkable protein-DNA interaction we used a variety of chemical probe
  methods and the missing nucleoside experiment to examine Flp binding. Hydroxyl radical
  footprints of Flp bound to a recombinationally-competent site fall on opposite faces
  of canonical B-DNA. The 8 bp spacer region between the two Flp binding sites becomes
  reactive towards 5-phenyl-1,10-phenanthroline.copper upon Flp binding, indicating
  that once bound by Flp, this segment of DNA is not in the B-form. Missing nucleoside
  analysis reveals that within each binding site the presence of two nucleosides on
  the top strand and four on the bottom, are required for formation of a fully-occupied
  FRT site. In contrast, loss of any nucleoside in the three binding sites in the
  FRT interferes with formation of lower-occupancy complexes. DNA molecules with gaps
  in the 8 bp spacer region are over-represented in complexes with either two or three
  binding sites occupied by Flp, evidence that DNA flexibility facilitates the cooperative
  interaction of Flp protomers bound to a recombinationally-active site.
