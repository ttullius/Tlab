abstract: 'The Fenton reaction of iron(II) EDTA with hydrogen peroxide, performed
  in the presence of ascorbate ion, has proven to be useful as a probe of structure
  in DNA systems. Two aspects of this chemistry are discussed: the identity of the
  active DNA cleaving agent produced by this reagent, and the application of the Fenton
  reaction to the determination of the structure of the Holliday junction, the four-stranded
  DNA molecule that is a key intermediate in recombination. The cleavage pattern of
  the Holliday junction has pseudo-twofold symmetry, putting important constraints
  on possible structures.'
