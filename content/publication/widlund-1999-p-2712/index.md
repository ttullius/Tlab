abstract: Nucleosomes, the fundamental building blocks of chromatin, play an architectural
  role in ensuring the integrity of the genome and act as a regulator of transcription.
  Intrinsic properties of the underlying DNA sequence, such as flexibility and intrinsic
  bending, direct the formation of nucleosomes. We have earlier identified genomic
  nucleosome-positioning sequences with increased in vitro ability for nucleosome
  formation. One group of sequences bearing a 10-base pair consensus repeat sequence
  of TATAAACGCC had the highest reported nucleosome affinity from genomic material.
  Here, we report the intrinsic physical properties of this sequence and the structural
  details of the nucleosome it forms, as analyzed by footprinting techniques. The
  minor groove is buried toward the histone octamer at the AA steps and facing outwards
  at the CC steps. By cyclization kinetics, the overall helical repeat of the free
  DNA sequence was found to be 10.5 base pairs/turn. Our experiments also showed that
  this sequence is highly flexible, having a J-factor 25-fold higher than that of
  random sequence DNA. In addition, the data suggest that twist flexibility is an
  important determinant for translational nucleosome positioning, particularly over
  the dyad region.
