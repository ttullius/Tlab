abstract: An efficient procedure is described for the preparation of ribonucleotides
  and deoxyribonucleotides with deuterium incorporated at the 1′, 4′, or 5′ position.
  Three intermediates-[1-2H]-d-ribose, [4-2H]-d-ribose, and [5-2H2]-d-ribose-were
  prepared by chemical synthesis and subsequently converted to ribonucleotides and
  deoxyribonucleotides via enzymatic reactions. Milligram quantities of the desired
  products were obtained with an average deuterium content of 96±1%.
