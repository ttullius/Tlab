 abstract = {An efficient procedure is described for the preparation of ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides with deuterium incorporated at the 1′, 4′, or 5′ position. Three intermediates-[1-2H]-d-ribose, [4-2H]-d-ribose, and [5-2H2]-d-ribose-were prepared by chemical synthesis and subsequently converted to ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides via enzymatic reactions. Milligram quantities of the desired products were obtained with an average deuterium content of 96±1%.},
