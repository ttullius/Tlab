abstract: 'We present here experimental evidence that three-arm branched DNA molecules
  form an asymmetric structure in the presence of Mg2+. Electrophoretic mobility and
  chemical and enzymatic footprinting experiments on a three-arm branched DNA molecule
  formed from three 16-mer strands are described. The electrophoretic mobilities of
  three species of a three-arm junction in which pairs of arms are extended are found
  to differ in the presence of Mg2+: one combination of elongated arms migrates significantly
  faster than the other two. This effect is eliminated in the absence of Mg2+, leading
  us to suggest that the three-arm DNA junction forms an asymmetric structure due
  to preferential stacking of two of the arms at the junction in the presence of Mg2+.
  The pattern of self-protection of each 16-mer strand of the core complex exposed
  to Fe(II).EDTA and DNase I scission is unique, consistent with formation of an asymmetric
  structure in the presence of Mg2+. We conclude that three-arm junctions resemble
  four-arm junctions in showing preferential stacking effects at the branch site.
  Comparison of the scission patterns of linear duplexes and the branched trimer by
  the reactive probes methidiumpropyl-EDTA.Fe(II) [MPE.Fe(II)] and Cu(I)-[o-phenanthroline]2
  [(OP)2CuI] further indicates that the branch point represents a site of enhanced
  binding for drugs, as it does in the four-arm case. Reaction with diethyl pyrocarbonate
  (DEPC), a purine-specific probe sensitive to conformation, is enhanced at the branch
  site, consistent with loosening of base pairing or unpairing at this point.(ABSTRACT
