abstract: The completion of the human genome project has fueled the search for regulatory
  elements by a variety of different approaches. Many successful analyses have focused
  on examining primary DNA sequence and/or chromatin structure. However, it has been
  difficult to detect common sequence motifs within the feature of chromatin structure
  most closely associated with regulatory elements, DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs).
  Considering just the nucleotide sequence and/or the chromatin structure of regulatory
  elements may neglect a critical feature of what is recognized by the regulatory
  machinery--DNA structure. We introduce a new computational method to detect common
  DNA structural motifs in a large collection of DHSs that are found in the ENCODE
  regions of the human genome. We show that DHSs have common DNA structural motifs
  that show no apparent sequence consensus. One such structural motif is much more
  highly enriched in experimentally identified DHSs that are in CpG islands and near
  transcription start sites (TSSs), compared to DHSs not in CpG islands and farther
  from TSSs, suggesting that DNA structural motifs may participate in the formation
  of functional regulatory elements. We propose that studies of the conservation of
  DNA structure, independent of sequence conservation, will provide new information
  about the link between the nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule and its experimentally
  demonstrated function.
