 abstract = {We describe here a detailed protocol for the synthesis of ribonucleotides specifically deuterated at each ribose carbon atom. We synthesized 20 specifically deuterated ribonucleo- tides: ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, each of which contained one of five deuterated riboses (either 1′-D, 2′′-D, 3′-D, 4′-D, or 5′,5′′-D2). Our synthetic approach is inspired by the pioneering work of Tolbert and Williamson, who developed a method for the convenient one-pot enzymatic synthesis of nucleotides (Tolbert, T. J. and Williamson, J. R. (1996) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118, 7929–7940). Our protocol consists of a comprehensive list of required chemical and enzymatic reagents and equip- ment, detailed procedures for enzymatic assays and nucleotide synthesis, and chromatographic procedures for purification of deuterated nucleotides. As an example of the utility of specif- ically deuterated nucleotides, we used them to synthesize specifically deuterated sarcin/ricin loop (SRL) RNA and meas- ured the deuterium kinetic isotope effect on hydroxyl radical cleavage of the SRL.},
