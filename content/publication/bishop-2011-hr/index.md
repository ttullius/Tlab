abstract: DNA shape variation and the associated variation in minor groove electrostatic
  potential are widely exploited by proteins for DNA recognition. Here we show that
  the hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern is a quantitative measure of DNA backbone
  solvent accessibility, minor groove width, and minor groove electrostatic potential,
  at single nucleotide resolution. We introduce maps of DNA shape and electrostatic
  potential as tools for understanding how proteins recognize binding sites in a genome.
  These maps reveal periodic structural signals in yeast and Drosophila genomic DNA
  sequences that are associated with positioned nucleosomes.
