abstract: The production and spectroscopic properties of an L-selenomethionine-containing
  homolog of Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin are described. The amino acid substitution
  was carried out by developing an L-methionine-dependent bacterial strain from a
  fully functional ATCC culture. Uptake studies monitored using L-[75Se]methionine
  indicated that L-selenomethionine was incorporated into the protein synthetic pathway
  of Pseudomonas bacteria in a manner analogous to L-methionine. Several batches of
  bacteria were grown, and one sample of isolated and purified selenoazurin (azurin
  in which methionine was substituted by selenomethionine) was found (by neutron activation
  analysis) to contain 5.2 +/- 0.8 seleniums/copper. Correspondingly, a residual 0.35
  methionines, relative to 6.0 in the native protein, were found by amino acid analysis
  in this azurin sample. The redox potential and extinction coefficient of this selenoazurin
  were found to be 333 +/- 1 mV (pH 7.0, I = 0.22) and 5855 +/- 160 M-1 cm-1 at 626
  +/- 1 nm, respectively. Visible electronic, CD, and EPR spectra are reported and
  Gaussian curve fitting to the former spectrum allowed assignment of the selenomethionine
  Se----Cu(II) transition to a band found at 18034 cm-1, based upon an observed 450
  cm-1 shift to the red from the analogous band position in the native protein. The
  data are consistent with a relatively more covalent copper site stabilizing the
  reduced, Cu(I), form in the selenoprotein. A role for the methionine as a modulator
  of the blue copper site redox potential by metal----ligand back bonding from Cu(I)
  is discussed in terms of a ligand sphere which limits the valence change at copper
  to much less than 1 during a redox cycle.
