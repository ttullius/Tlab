abstract: The three-dimensional molecular structure of DNA, specifically the shape
  of the backbone and grooves of genomic DNA, can be dramatically affected by nucleotide
  changes, which can cause differences in protein-binding affinity and phenotype.
  We developed an algorithm to measure constraint on the basis of similarity of DNA
  topography among multiple species, using hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns to interrogate
  the solvent-accessible surface area of DNA. This algorithm found that 12% of bases
  in the human genome are evolutionarily constrained-double the number detected by
  nucleotide sequence-based algorithms. Topography-informed constrained regions correlated
  with functional noncoding elements, including enhancers, better than did regions
  identified solely on the basis of nucleotide sequence. These results support the
  idea that the molecular shape of DNA is under selection and can identify evolutionary
  history.
