abstract: Immobile DNA junctions are complexes of oligomeric DNA strands that interact
  to yield branched structures in which the branch point cannot migrate. This is achieved
  by minimizing the sequence symmetry in the flanking arms, so that base pairs lock
  at the branch site. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and analysis of two semimobile
  junctions, structures in which a controlled extent of branch point migratory freedom
  is deliberately introduced. We have constructed two minimally symmetric four-arm
  semimobile junctions from synthetic deoxy 17-mers. These junctions, termed \"monomobile\",
  contain a single pair of base pairs (A-T or C-G) which can migrate at the site of
  branching, while the rest of the junction is immobile. We have demonstrated by gel
  electrophoresis techniques that these junctions form and that they have the predicted
  1:1:1:1 stoichiometry. We have compared these junctions with the immobile junction
  on which they are based, by means of hydroxyl radical protection experiments. From
  these data, both migratory conformers can be seen to coexist in solution. The semimobile
  junction with the C-G base pair has the same crossover and stacking pattern observed
  for the immobile junction, while the junction with the A-T base pair has the opposite
  pattern. We conclude that crossover and stacking patterns are a direct consequence
  of the base pairs which flank the junction. In addition, the data indicate that
  the crossover pattern biases for these junctions are much greater than are the migratory
  biases.
