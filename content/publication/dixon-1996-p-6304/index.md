abstract: Induction of the copper metallothionein (CUP1) gene of the yeast Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae is achieved by CUP2, a transcriptional activator protein which has a
  metal-dependent DNA-binding activity. It is thought that metal binding to CUP2 results
  in the formation of several looped regions of the protein which then are capable
  of binding to DNA. CUP2 binds to a site near the CUP1 gene called upstream activation
  sequence c (UASc), an imperfect inverted repeat. While CUP2 binds to both half-sites
  of UASc, the upstream half-site appears to be more important for transcriptional
  activity. A variant of CUP2 called ace1, in which cysteine-11 is replaced by tyrosine,
  binds to DNA but is incapable of activating transcription. We have used hydroxyl
  radical footprinting and missing nucleoside analysis to examine the complexes of
  wild-type CUP2 and the ace1 mutant protein with UASc. Our results indicate that
  ace1 interacts with a smaller portion of UASc than does CUP2, providing further
  evidence that the DNA-binding domain of CUP2 is complex, composed of two or more
  elements that recognize distinct features of UASc. We also show that CUP2 itself
  binds slightly differently to the two half-sites of UASc. While CUP2 and ace1 bind
  in a rather similar manner to the downstream half-site, in the upstream half-site
  CUP2 makes more extensive interactions. Our results suggest that the more crucial
  role that the upstream half-site plays in transcriptional activation may be due
  to differences in how CUP2 binds to each of the half-sites of UASc.
