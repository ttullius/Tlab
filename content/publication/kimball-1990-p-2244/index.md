abstract: The Holliday junction is a four-stranded DNA intermediate that arises during
  recombination reactions. We have designed and constructed a set of Holliday junction
  analogs that model each of the ideal conformations available to a 2-fold symmetric
  four-arm junction. The strategy used is to connect two arms of a junction molecule
  with a short tether of thymidines. These DNA molecules share a common core sequence
  but have different arms that are connected so that each molecule is constrained
  in either an antiparallel or a parallel structure. For tethered antiparallel molecules
  the identity of the crossover strands is determined by which arms are connected.
  Different arm connections gave molecules representing each of the two antiparallel
  crossover isomers. Two parallel molecules that differ in the length and position
  of the tether exhibit opposite biases in their choice of crossover strands. Thus,
  a physical constraint applied at a distance from the branch point can determine
  the conformation of a junction.
