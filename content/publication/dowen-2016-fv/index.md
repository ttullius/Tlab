abstract: Animals integrate metabolic, developmental, and environmental information
  before committing key resources to reproduction. In Caenorhabditis elegans, adult
  animals transport fat from intestinal cells to the germline to promote reproduction.
  We identified a microRNA (miRNA)-regulated developmental timing pathway that functions
  in the hypodermis to nonautonomously coordinate the mobilization of intestinal fat
  stores to the germline upon initiation of adulthood. This developmental timing pathway,
  which is controlled by the lin-4 and let-7 miRNAs, engages mTOR signaling in the
  intestine. The intestinal signaling component is specific to mTORC2 and functions
  in parallel to the insulin pathway to modulate the activity of the serum/glucocorticoid-regulated
  kinase (SGK-1). Surprisingly, SGK-1 functions independently of DAF-16/FoxO; instead,
  SGK-1 promotes the cytoplasmic localization of the PQM-1 transcription factor, which
  antagonizes intestinal fat mobilization at the transcriptional level when localized
  to the nucleus. These results revealed that a non-cell-autonomous developmental
  input regulates intestinal fat metabolism by engaging mTORC2 signaling to promote
  the intertissue transport of fat reserves from the soma to the germline.
