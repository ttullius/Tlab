abstract: Deformed (Dfd) and Ultrabithorax (Ubx) are homeodomain proteins from Drosophila
  melanogaster that exert regulatory effects on gene expression by binding to specific
  target sites in the fly genome using a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif. The recognition
  helices of these two proteins are almost identical and the DNA sequences they recognize
  are similar, containing a conserved TAAT core sequence flanked by a somewhat variable
  sequence. Yet the in vivo functions of the two proteins are quite different. We
  have used the homeodomains of these two proteins and in vitro selected DNA binding
  sites to characterize the structural details of homeodomain binding to DNA and to
  understand the basis for the differences in sequence specificity between homeodomains
  with similar recognition helices. We have employed hydroxyl radical cleavage of
  DNA to study the positioning of the proteins on the binding sites and have analyzed
  the effects of missing nucleosides and purine methylation on homeodomain binding.
  Our results indicate that the positioning of the Ubx and Dfd homeodomains on their
  binding sites is consistent with reported structures of other homeodomain/DNA complexes.
  Dfd and Ubx bind to DNA with the recognition helix in the major groove 3' to the
  TAAT core sequence and the N-terminal arm in the adjacent minor groove. However,
  we observe striking differences between the two homeodomains in their specific interactions
  with DNA. Missing nucleosides within the selected binding sites have differential
  effects on protein binding, which are dependent on the identity of the homeodomain.
  Differences at the 3' end of the binding site on the top strand indicate that the
  N-terminal arm of a homeodomain is capable of distinguishing an A.T base-pair from
  T.A in the minor groove. Specific orientation of the N-terminal arm within the binding
  site appears to vary between the homeodomains and influences the interaction of
  the recognition helix with the major groove.
