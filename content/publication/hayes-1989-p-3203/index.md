abstract: We report a new technique for quickly determining which nucleosides in a
  DNA molecule are contacted by a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. Our method
  is related to the recently reported \"missing contact\" experiment [Brunelle, A.,
  & Schleif, R. F. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 6673-6679]. We treat the
  DNA molecule with the hydroxyl radical to randomly remove nucleosides. The ability
  of protein to bind to gapped DNA is assayed by gel mobility shift. Nucleosides important
  to protein binding are identified by sequencing gel electrophoresis. The missing
  nucleoside experiment can be used to scan a DNA molecule at single-nucleotide resolution
  in one experiment. The bacteriophage lambda repressor-OR1 and cro-OR1 complexes
  were analyzed to evaluate the method. For both proteins, the most important contacts
  are located in the protein monomer that binds to the consensus half of the operator.
  These contacts correspond well to those found by mutational studies, and in the
  cocrystal structure of the lambda repressor-operator. The missing nucleoside data
  show that the amino-terminal arms of lambda repressor make energetically important
  contacts with positions 7 and 8 and the central dyad base pair of the operator.
  The amino-terminal arm that makes the most extensive contacts to DNA appears to
  be the one that emanates from the repressor monomer that binds to the consensus
  half of the operator, in agreement with the cocrystal structure. The lambda cro
  protein does not have an amino-terminal arm, and the missing nucleoside experiment
  clearly shows a lack of contacts to DNA in the central region of the operator in
  this complex.
