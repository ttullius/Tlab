abstract: We constructed two site-specifically modified nucleosomes containing an
  intrastrand cis-Pt(NH3)22+ 1,3-d(GpTpG) cross-link, similar to one formed by the
  anticancer drugs carboplatin and cisplatin on DNA, and investigated their structures
  by hydroxyl radical footprinting and exonuclease III digestion. Hydroxyl radical
  footprinting demonstrated that the presence of the platinum cross-link selects out
  a specific rotational setting of DNA on the histone octamer core in each of two
  reconstituted nucleosomes in which the platinum positions differ by half a DNA helical
  turn. The Pt(NH3)22+ cross-link is situated in a structurally similar location,
  with the undamaged strand projecting outward, forcing the DNA to adopt opposite
  rotational settings in its wrapping around the histone octamer in the two nucleosomes.
  Enzymatic digestion by exonuclease III of the nucleosome substrates revealed that
  the platinum cross-link affects the translational positioning of the DNA, forcing
  it into an asymmetric arrangement with respect to the core histone proteins. We
  suggest that these phasing phenomena may be central to the recognition and processing
  of platinum-DNA adducts in cancer cells treated with these drugs and possibly may
  be common to other DNA damaging events.
