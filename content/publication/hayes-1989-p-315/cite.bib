 abstract = {Stable complex formation on a Xenopus somatic 5 S RNA gene requires protein-protein interactions between the non-DNA binding domain of transcription factor (TF) IIIA and activities in a TFIIIC fraction. No significant changes in the structure of the TFIIIA.DNA complex can be detected as a consequence of stabilization, indicating that protein confirmation is the primary determinant of stability.},
