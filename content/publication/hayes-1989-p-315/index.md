abstract: Stable complex formation on a Xenopus somatic 5 S RNA gene requires protein-protein
  interactions between the non-DNA binding domain of transcription factor (TF) IIIA
  and activities in a TFIIIC fraction. No significant changes in the structure of
  the TFIIIA.DNA complex can be detected as a consequence of stabilization, indicating
  that protein confirmation is the primary determinant of stability.
