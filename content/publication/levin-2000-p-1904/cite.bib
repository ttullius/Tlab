 abstract = {We have examined the effects of removing individual template nucleosides on promoter escape by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in vitro. The ability of DNA templates containing random single nucleoside gaps generated by hydroxyl radical treatment to support the production of stable ternary transcription complexes was analyzed. On two templates containing different promoter and initial transcribed regions, we found that removal of nucleosides on the template strand in the region from -13 to at least +8 relative to the transcription start site interfered with ternary complex formation. The downstream border of this region varied for the two templates, suggesting an effect of the specific nucleotide sequence on the stability of intermediates in the promoter escape process. On the nontemplate strand, removal of nucleosides in the vicinity of the -10 consensus promoter element interfered with escape, whereas removal of nucleosides in the vicinity of the transcription start site actually enhanced the yield of ternary complexes. On one template, removal of nucleosides in an A-tract containing region upstream of the promoter caused a significant decrease in promoter escape, consistent with previous suggestions that contacts between this region and the RNA polymerase play a role in promoter binding and/or initiation.},
