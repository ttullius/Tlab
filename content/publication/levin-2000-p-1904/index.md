abstract: We have examined the effects of removing individual template nucleosides
  on promoter escape by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in vitro. The ability of DNA
  templates containing random single nucleoside gaps generated by hydroxyl radical
  treatment to support the production of stable ternary transcription complexes was
  analyzed. On two templates containing different promoter and initial transcribed
  regions, we found that removal of nucleosides on the template strand in the region
  from -13 to at least +8 relative to the transcription start site interfered with
  ternary complex formation. The downstream border of this region varied for the two
  templates, suggesting an effect of the specific nucleotide sequence on the stability
  of intermediates in the promoter escape process. On the nontemplate strand, removal
  of nucleosides in the vicinity of the -10 consensus promoter element interfered
  with escape, whereas removal of nucleosides in the vicinity of the transcription
  start site actually enhanced the yield of ternary complexes. On one template, removal
  of nucleosides in an A-tract containing region upstream of the promoter caused a
  significant decrease in promoter escape, consistent with previous suggestions that
  contacts between this region and the RNA polymerase play a role in promoter binding
  and/or initiation.
