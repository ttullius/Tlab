abstract: Although the three-letter genetic code that maps nucleotide sequence to
  protein sequence is well known, there must exist other codes that are embedded in
  the human genome. Recent work points to sequence-dependent variation in DNA shape
  as one mechanism by which regulatory and other information could be encoded in DNA.
  Recent advances include the discovery of shape-dependent recognition of DNA that
  depends on minor groove width and electrostatics, the existence of overlapping codes
  in protein-coding regions of the genome, and evolutionary selection for compensatory
  changes in nucleotide composition that facilitate nucleosome occupancy. It is becoming
  clear that DNA shape is important to biological function, and therefore will be
  subject to evolutionary constraint.
