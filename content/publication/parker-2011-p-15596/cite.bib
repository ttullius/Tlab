 abstract = {Although the three-letter genetic code that maps nucleotide sequence to protein sequence is well known, there must exist other codes that are embedded in the human genome. Recent work points to sequence-dependent variation in DNA shape as one mechanism by which regulatory and other information could be encoded in DNA. Recent advances include the discovery of shape-dependent recognition of DNA that depends on minor groove width and electrostatics, the existence of overlapping codes in protein-coding regions of the genome, and evolutionary selection for compensatory changes in nucleotide composition that facilitate nucleosome occupancy. It is becoming clear that DNA shape is important to biological function, and therefore will be subject to evolutionary constraint.},
