abstract: The hydroxyl radical has been used as a chemical probe to study in solution
  the structure of DNA and DNA-protein complexes. The hydroxyl radical abstracts a
  deoxyribose hydrogen atom, cleaving one strand of the DNA. The cutting pattern,
  visualized by separating the cleavage products using gel electrophoresis, shows
  the reactivity of each backbone position toward the radical. This method has been
  applied to studies of DNA bending and helical twist. Phased runs of adenines (adenine
  tracts) cause sequence-directed DNA bending. The hydroxyl radical cleavage of a
  bent DNA fragment containing short adenine tracts phased with the helix screw gives
  rise to an unusual cutting pattern. The hydroxyl radical cleavage rate decreases
  in the 5' to 3' direction along each adenine tract, with a minimum at the 3' end
  of each adenine tract. The cleavage of the matching thymine tract is similar, but
  the minimum in the pattern is offset in the 3' direction. This pattern on the autoradiograph
  of the gel is interpreted to indicate that bending is accompanied by a narrow minor
  groove in the DNA molecule. Furthermore, hydroxyl radical cleavage results in different
  cutting patterns for two similar sequences, (CGA4T4)5 and (CGT4A4)5, which have
  been shown to be bent and relatively straight, respectively. The hydroxyl radical
  method has also been used to determine the helical repeat of the metallothionein
  IIA gene to be about 10.5 base pairs per turn. Methods of optimizing the hydroxyl
  radical reaction for DNA-protein footprinting are discussed. Because individual
  gel bands give information about cutting frequency at particular positions in the
  backbone, gel resolution and clear autoradiographs are important to this work.(ABSTRACT
