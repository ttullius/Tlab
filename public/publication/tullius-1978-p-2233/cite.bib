 abstract = {The primary coordination environment of the “blue” copper ion in oxidized azurin has been elucidated by x-ray absorption spectroscopy. The most striking feature is the unambiguous presence of a very short copper-sulfur distance at 2.10 ± 0.02 Å. Nitrogen ligands, presumed to be from imidazoles, are found at 1.97 Å. There is some evidence that the copper coordination sphere may be completed by a second sulfur, the distance of which is determined with much less certainty.},
