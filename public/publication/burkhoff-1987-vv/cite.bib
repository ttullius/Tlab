 abstract = {To determine the structural features responsible for the curvature of kinetoplast DNA, we studied 13 adenine tracts in Crithidia fasciculata kinetoplast DNA. The structures of the A tracts were analyzed by cutting the DNA with hydroxyl radical. Reactivity of hydroxyl radical toward the DNA backbone progressively decreased in the 5′→3′ direction of each A tract. The cutting pattern of the T-rich strand was offset by 1 or 2 bp from the pattern on the A-rich strand. An A tract in a restriction fragment from plasmid pBR322 had the same cutting pattern as the kinetoplast A tracts. We interpret these experiments to show that in A tracts the width of the minor groove decreases smoothly from the 5′→3′ end of the A tract.},
