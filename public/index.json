[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Tom Tullius is Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Graduate Program in Bioinformatics at Boston University. He received his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1979 in bioinorganic chemistry, working with Keith O. Hodgson on X-ray spectroscopy of metalloproteins. He was an NIH postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University from 1979-1982 in the laboratory of Stephen J. Lippard, studying the interaction of platinum antitumor drugs with DNA. He began his independent academic career in 1982 at The Johns Hopkins University, where he was Professor of Chemistry, Biophysics, and Biology and the McCollum-Pratt Institute. He moved to Boston University in 1997 to become Chair of the Department of Chemistry (1997-2005). His awards include an Ellison Medical Foundation Senior Scholar Award in Aging, the Herbert A. Sober Award of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and a Searle Scholar award. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\nTom Tullius is widely known for introducing a powerful chemistry-based method, hydroxyl radical footprinting, for determining structural details of nucleic acids. Systems his laboratory has studied include the nucleosome, the Holliday junction recombination intermediate, bent DNA, and a wide variety of DNA-protein complexes. Tullius lab publications have been very highly cited – five key papers have been cited in more than 2000 scientific papers. Hydroxyl radical footprinting has been adopted by many scientists in related fields, to determine the structures of large RNAs and to follow the kinetics of folding of RNA. In recent years the Tullius laboratory has focused on studies at the whole-genome level. As part of the ENCODE Consortium, the Tullius lab used the hydroxyl radical method to make a high-resolution structural map of the human genome. The lab’s most exciting recent finding is that there is evolutionary selection for DNA shape that is not evident in the conservation of nucleotide sequence. The new genomic \u0026ldquo;grammar\u0026rdquo; that the Tullius lab is beginning to describe has the promise to revolutionize our understanding of the role of DNA shape and structure in biology.\nTom has been profiled by The Scientist.\n  Download my cv.\n","date":1549324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1567641600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/tom-tullius/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/tom-tullius/","section":"authors","summary":"Tom Tullius is Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Graduate Program in Bioinformatics at Boston University.

Often unanswered is whether the structure of naked DNA persists in a protein–DNA complex, or whether protein binding changes DNA shape. While X-ray structures of protein–DNA complexes are numerous, the structure of naked cognate DNA is seldom available experimentally. We present here an experimental and computational analysis pipeline that uses hydroxyl radical cleavage to map, at single-nucleotide resolution, DNA minor groove width, a recognition feature widely exploited by proteins. For 11 protein–DNA complexes, we compared experimental maps of naked DNA minor groove width with minor groove width measured from X-ray co-crystal structures. Seven sites had similar minor groove widths as naked DNA and when bound to protein. For four sites, part of the DNA in the complex had the same structure as naked DNA, and part changed structure upon protein binding. We compared the experimental map with minor groove patterns of DNA predicted by two computational approaches, DNAshape and ORChID2, and found good but not perfect concordance with both. This experimental approach will be useful in mapping structures of DNA sequences for which high-resolution structural data are unavailable. This approach allows probing of protein family-dependent readout mechanisms.","tags":["\"TT talk\""],"title":"Experimental maps of DNA structure at nucleotide resolution distinguish intrinsic from protein-induced DNA deformations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, adult animals transport fat from intestinal cells to the germline to promote reproduction. We identified a microRNA (miRNA)-regulated developmental timing pathway that functions in the hypodermis to nonautonomously coordinate the mobilization of intestinal fat stores to the germline upon initiation of adulthood. This developmental timing pathway, which is controlled by the lin-4 and let-7 miRNAs, engages mTOR signaling in the intestine. The intestinal signaling component is specific to mTORC2 and functions in parallel to the insulin pathway to modulate the activity of the serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK-1). Surprisingly, SGK-1 functions independently of DAF-16/FoxO; instead, SGK-1 promotes the cytoplasmic localization of the PQM-1 transcription factor, which antagonizes intestinal fat mobilization at the transcriptional level when localized to the nucleus. These results revealed that a non-cell-autonomous developmental input regulates intestinal fat metabolism by engaging mTORC2 signaling to promote the intertissue transport of fat reserves from the soma to the germline.","tags":[],"title":"A microRNA program in the C. elegans hypodermis couples to intestinal mTORC2/PQM-1 signaling to modulate fat transport.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert N Azad","Shakti Ingle","Thomas D Tullius"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603327314,"objectID":"860d49071e516e04578960d5393f9e7b","permalink":"/publication/azad-2015-kb/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T00:41:54.010814Z","relpermalink":"/publication/azad-2015-kb/","section":"publication","summary":"We describe here a detailed protocol for the synthesis of ribonucleotides specifically deuterated at each ribose carbon atom.

Nucleotide sequence does not provide an answer to the question of why a protein binds only to a small subset of the many putative binding sites in the genome that share the same core motif. Whereas higher-order effects, such as chromatin accessibility, cooperativity and cofactors, have been described, DNA shape recently gained attention as another feature that fine-tunes the DNA binding specificities of some transcription factor families. Our Genome Browser for DNA shape annotations (GBshape; freely available at http://rohslab.cmb.usc.edu/GBshape/) provides minor groove width, propeller twist, roll, helix twist and hydroxyl radical cleavage predictions for the entire genomes of 94 organisms. Additional genomes can easily be added using the GBshape framework. GBshape can be used to visualize DNA shape annotations qualitatively in a genome browser track format, and to download quantitative values of DNA shape features as a function of genomic position at nucleotide resolution. As biological applications, we illustrate the periodicity of DNA shape features that are present in nucleosome-occupied sequences from human, fly and worm, and we demonstrate structural similarities between transcription start sites in the genomes of four Drosophila species.","tags":[],"title":"GBshape: a genome browser database for DNA shape annotations.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shakti Ingle","Robert N Azad","Swapan S Jain","Thomas D Tullius"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603327314,"objectID":"125fc1e9338d31309e5f9a1b7b24bd64","permalink":"/publication/anonymous-2014-cs/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T00:41:54.369798Z","relpermalink":"/publication/anonymous-2014-cs/","section":"publication","summary":"While hydroxyl radical cleavage is widely used to map RNA tertiary structure, lack of mechanistic understanding of strand break formation limits the degree of structural insight that can be obtained from this experiment. Here, we determine how individual ribose hydrogens of sarcin/ricin loop RNA participate in strand cleavage. We find that substituting deuterium for hydrogen at a ribose 5'-carbon produces a kinetic isotope effect on cleavage; the major cleavage product is an RNA strand terminated by a 5'-aldehyde. We conclude that hydroxyl radical abstracts a 5'-hydrogen atom, leading to RNA strand cleavage. We used this approach to obtain structural information for a GUA base triple, a common tertiary structural feature of RNA. Cleavage at U exhibits a large 5' deuterium kinetic isotope effect, a potential signature of a base triple. Others had noted a ribose-phosphate hydrogen bond involving the G 2'-OH and the U phosphate of the GUA triple, and suggested that this hydrogen bond contributes to backbone rigidity. Substituting deoxyguanosine for G, to eliminate this hydrogen bond, results in a substantial decrease in cleavage at G and U of the triple. We conclude that this hydrogen bond is a linchpin of backbone structure around the triple.","tags":["\"grant NSF RNA\"","\"paper deuterated nuc synth\"","\"TT talk\""],"title":"Chemical probing of RNA with the hydroxyl radical at single-atom resolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joshua W K Ho","Youngsook L Jung","Tao Liu","Burak H Alver","Soohyun Lee","Kohta Ikegami","Kyung-Ah Sohn","Aki Minoda","Michael Y Tolstorukov","Alex Appert","Stephen C J Parker","Tingting Gu","Anshul Kundaje","Nicole C Riddle","Eric Bishop","Thea A Egelhofer","Sheng'en Shawn Hu","Artyom A Alekseyenko","Andreas Rechtsteiner","Dalal Asker","Jason A Belsky","Sarah K Bowman","Q Brent Chen","Ron A J Chen","Daniel S Day","Yan Dong","Andrea C Dose","Xikun Duan","Charles B Epstein","Sevinc Ercan","Elise A Feingold","Francesco Ferrari","Jacob M Garrigues","Nils Gehlenborg","Peter J Good","Psalm Haseley","Daniel He","Moritz Herrmann","Michael M Hoffman","Tess E Jeffers","Peter V Kharchenko","Paulina Kolasinska-Zwierz","Chitra V Kotwaliwale","Nischay Kumar","Sasha A Langley","Erica N Larschan","Isabel Latorre","Maxwell W Libbrecht","Xueqiu Lin","Richard Park","Michael J Pazin","Hoang N Pham","Annette Plachetka","Bo Qin","Yuri B Schwartz","Noam Shoresh","Przemyslaw Stempor","Anne Vielle","Chengyang Wang","Christina M Whittle","Huiling Xue","Robert E Kingston","Ju Han Kim","Bradley E Bernstein","Abby F Dernburg","Vincenzo Pirrotta","Mitzi I Kuroda","William Stafford Noble","Thomas D Tullius","Manolis Kellis","David M MacAlpine","Susan Strome","Sarah C R Elgin","Xiaole Shirley Liu","Jason D Lieb","Julie Ahringer","Gary H Karpen","Peter J Park"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603327314,"objectID":"12f010fd3e1cb57ffbbec6098ed9a751","permalink":"/publication/ho-2014-eg/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T00:41:54.557685Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ho-2014-eg/","section":"publication","summary":"Genome function is dynamically regulated in part by chromatin, which consists of the histones, non-histone proteins and RNA molecules that package DNA. Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have contributed substantially to our understanding of molecular mechanisms of genome function in humans, and have revealed conservation of chromatin components and mechanisms. Nevertheless, the three organisms have markedly different genome sizes, chromosome architecture and gene organization. On human and fly chromosomes, for example, pericentric heterochromatin flanks single centromeres, whereas worm chromosomes have dispersed heterochromatin-like regions enriched in the distal chromosomal 'arms', and centromeres distributed along their lengths. To systematically investigate chromatin organization and associated gene regulation across species, we generated and analysed a large collection of genome-wide chromatin data sets from cell lines and developmental stages in worm, fly and human. Here we present over 800 new data sets from our ENCODE and modENCODE consortia, bringing the total to over 1,400. Comparison of combinatorial patterns of histone modifications, nuclear lamina-associated domains, organization of large-scale topological domains, chromatin environment at promoters and enhancers, nucleosome positioning, and DNA replication patterns reveals many conserved features of chromatin organization among the three organisms. We also find notable differences in the composition and locations of repressive chromatin. These data sets and analyses provide a rich resource for comparative and species-specific investigations of chromatin composition, organization and function.","tags":[],"title":"Comparative analysis of metazoan chromatin organization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas D Tullius","Stephen C J Parker","Aaron Harlap"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603327314,"objectID":"968ff28abe5d5e8084292a72b2a059cd","permalink":"/publication/parker-2011-p-16010/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T00:41:54.739446Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parker-2011-p-16010/","section":"publication","summary":"The rapidly increasing availability of DNA sequence data from modern high-throughput experimental techniques has created the need for computational algorithms to aid in motif discovery in genomic DNA. Such algorithms are typically used to find a statistical representation of the nucleotide sequence of the target site of a DNA-binding protein within a collection of DNA sequences that are thought to contain segments to which the protein is bound. A major assumption of these algorithms is that the protein recognizes the primary order of nucleotides in the sequence. However, proteins can also recognize the three-dimensional shape and structure of DNA. To account for this, we developed a computational method to predict the local structural profiles of any set of DNA sequences and then to search within these profiles for common DNA structural motifs.

While this s a useful device for representing the information in a genome, the molecular nature of DNA is obscured. Proteins cannot actually “read” DNA letters – they   discriminate between DNA binding sites via molecular recognition, which is  sensitive to DNA structure. Since shape is essential to DNA’s biological function, we hypothesized that natural selection can act to preserve DNA shape without  maintaining the exact sequence of nucleotides. To test this hypothesis, we developed a DNA structure database, ORChID, and used it to map structural variation throughout the human genome. We then devised a computational algorithm, Chai, to detect evolutionary constraint on DNA shape. We found that Chai regions correlate better with experimental functional elements than do genomic regions that are sequence-constrained.

Many successful analyses have focused on examining primary DNA sequence and/or chromatin structure. However, it has been difficult to detect common sequence motifs within the feature of chromatin structure most closely associated with regulatory elements, DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs). Considering just the nucleotide sequence and/or the chromatin structure of regulatory elements may neglect a critical feature of what is recognized by the regulatory machinery--DNA structure. We introduce a new computational method to detect common DNA structural motifs in a large collection of DHSs that are found in the ENCODE regions of the human genome. We show that DHSs have common DNA structural motifs that show no apparent sequence consensus. One such structural motif is much more highly enriched in experimentally identified DHSs that are in CpG islands and near transcription start sites (TSSs), compared to DHSs not in CpG islands and farther from TSSs, suggesting that DNA structural motifs may participate in the formation of functional regulatory elements. We propose that studies of the conservation of DNA structure, independent of sequence conservation, will provide new information about the link between the nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule and its experimentally demonstrated function.","tags":[],"title":"Detection of DNA structural motifs in functional genomic elements.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qun Wang","Thomas D Tullius","Judith R Levin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603327316,"objectID":"1a150599e214be6d98db751118ab3f90","permalink":"/publication/wang-2007-p-5091/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T00:41:56.658851Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2007-p-5091/","section":"publication","summary":"Using singly gapped or nicked templates containing the T7A1 promoter, we have measured several kinetic parameters related to the process of transcription initiation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, confirming and extending previous results using a population of randomly gapped templates. A reduced probability of transcript abortion at RNA lengths of 6 and 7 nucleotides and a lower ratio of abortive to productive initiation events was observed for some discontinuous templates, consistent with models attributing abortive initiation to the accumulation of strain in the initiating complex. The effect of DNA discontinuity on abortion of shorter RNA transcripts (2-3 nucleotides) was less pronounced; abortion at these short chain lengths may primarily be attributed to the low stability of the RNA-DNA hybrid. Certain discontinuities had significant effects on the intrinsic catalytic capacity of the open complex and also on the partitioning between productive and unproductive complexes, suggesting that subtle changes in the conformation of the open complex can profoundly affect its function. The rate and efficiency of promoter escape were not correlated with the stability of the open promoter complex despite previous suggestions to the contrary. We conclude that the stability of the open promoter complex is only one of several factors that contribute to the overall rate of promoter escape.","tags":[],"title":"Effects of discontinuities in the

These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome.

Hydroxyl radical footprinting demonstrated that the presence of the platinum cross-link selects out a specific rotational setting of DNA on the histone octamer core in each of two reconstituted nucleosomes in which the platinum positions differ by half a DNA helical turn. The Pt(NH3)22+ cross-link is situated in a structurally similar location, with the undamaged strand projecting outward, forcing the DNA to adopt opposite rotational settings in its wrapping around the histone octamer in the two nucleosomes. Enzymatic digestion by exonuclease III of the nucleosome substrates revealed that the platinum cross-link affects the translational positioning of the DNA, forcing it into an asymmetric arrangement with respect to the core histone proteins.

DNA binding is largely accomplished via a highly conserved helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain that is known as a homeodomain (HD). Despite nearly identical DNA recognition helices and similar target DNA sequence preferences, the in vivo functions of the two proteins are quite different. We have previously revealed differences between the two HDs in their interactions with DNA. In an effort to define the individual roles of the HD N-terminal arm and recognition helix in sequence-specific binding, we have characterized the structural details of two Dfd/Ubx chimeric HDs in complex with both the Dfd and Ubx-optimal-binding site sequences. We utilized hydroxyl radical cleavage of DNA to assess the positioning of the proteins on the binding sites. The effects of missing nucleosides and purine methylation on HD binding were also analyzed. Our results show that both the Dfd and Ubx HDs have similar DNA-binding modes when in complex with the Ubx-optimal site. There are subtle but reproducible differences in these modes that are completely interchanged when the Dfd N-terminal arm is replaced with the corresponding region of the Ubx HD. In contrast, we showed previously that the Dfd-optimal site sequence elicits a very different binding mode for the Ubx HD, while the Dfd HD maintains a mode similar to that elicited by the Ubx-optimal site. Our current methylation interference studies suggest that this alternate binding mode involves interaction of the Ubx N-terminal arm with the minor groove on the opposite face of DNA relative to the major groove that is occupied by the recognition helix. As judged by hydroxyl radical footprinting and the missing nucleoside experiment, it appears that interaction of the Ubx recognition helix with the DNA major groove is reduced. Replacing the Dfd N-terminal arm with that of Ubx does not elicit a complete interchange of the DNA-binding mode. Although the position of the chimera relative to DNA, as judged by hydroxyl radical footprinting, is similar to that of the Dfd HD, the missing nucleoside and methylation interference patterns resemble those of the Ubx HD. Repositioning of amino acid side-chains without wholesale structural alteration in the polypeptide appears to occur as a function of N-terminal arm identity and DNA-binding site sequence. Complete interchange of binding modes was achieved only by replacement of the Dfd N-terminal arm and the recognition helix plus 13 carboxyl-terminal residues with the corresponding residues of Ubx. The position of the N-terminal arm in the DNA minor groove appears to differ in a manner that depends on the two base-pair differences between the Dfd and Ubx-optimal-binding sites. Thus, N-terminal arm position dictates the binding mode and the interaction of the recognition helix with nucleosides in the major groove.","tags":[],"title":"Interchange of DNA-binding Modes in the Deformed and Ultrabithorax Homeodomains: A Structural Role for the N-terminal Arm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Minwan Wu","Doris Stoermer","Thomas D Tullius","Craig A Townsend"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":946684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603327318,"objectID":"39672015b35b40908f8ca0d62c5738a5","permalink":"/publication/wu-2000-p-6300/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T00:41:58.06413Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wu-2000-p-6300/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Calicheamicin−Homeodomain Conjugate as an Efficient, Sequence-Specific DNA Cleavage and Mapping Tool","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L M Ottinger","Thomas D Tullius"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":946684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603327318,"objectID":"84bc82484abdc73a9174bbf4a63e2327","permalink":"/publication/anonymous-2000-dl/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T00:41:58.21584Z","relpermalink":"/publication/anonymous-2000-dl/","section":"publication","summary":"The imminent prospect of the sequencing of the human genome has focused attention on how the information encoded in DNA is expressed in living organisms.

We then measured deuterium kinetic isotope effects on the rate of cleavage of DNA by the hydroxyl radical. These experiments demonstrate that the hydroxyl radical reacts with the various hydrogen atoms of the deoxyribose in the order 5′ H  4′ H  3′ H ≈ 2′ H ≈ 1′ H. This order of reactivity parallels the exposure to solvent of the deoxyribose hydrogens. Our work therefore reveals the structural basis of the reaction of the hydroxyl radical with DNA.

The gene product of engrailed contains a homeodomain which is responsible for DNA binding via a helix-turn-helix motif. The crystal structure of this 60 amino acid residue domain complexed to DNA is analogous to structures of other homeodomain-DNA complexes, consistent with the high degree of sequence conservation within both protein and DNA. Despite the high degree of homology, homeodomains do exhibit distinct preferences for certain DNA sequences. Such specificity may be at least partly responsible for the interactions necessary for normal development. Using the hydroxyl radical as a chemical probe, we have examined complexes of Engrailed homeodomain with several DNA sequences to determine the protein's binding specificity in solution. We find that Engrailed forms a single, specific complex with a unique DNA binding site which is analogous to the complex seen in the co-crystal structure. In contrast, our chemical probe experiments show that the binding site of Engrailed that was determined by in vitro selection and that also was present in the co-crystal structure contains two possible binding sites. Modification of the sequence of this site to yield single binding sites removes the ambiguity, and results in two different, well-behaved Engrailed-DNA complexes.

Unlike most curve fitting approaches, the data is treated in two dimensions, fitting all the data across the entire width of the lane. This allows for accurate determination of the intensities of individual, overlapping bands, and in particular allows imperfectly shaped bands to be accurately modeled.

The enzyme cleaves the viral DNA ends in a sequence-dependent manner and couples the newly generated hydroxyl groups to phosphates in the target DNA. Three domains have been identified in HIV integrase: an amino-terminal domain, a central catalytic core and a carboxy-terminal DNA-binding domain. The amino-terminal region is the only domain with unknown structure thus far. This domain, which is known to bind zinc, contains a HHCC motif that is conserved in retroviral integrases. Although the exact function of this domain is unknown, it is required for cleavage and integration. Results: The three-dimensional structure of the amino-terminal domain of HIV-2 integrase has been determined using two-dimensional and three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance data. We obtained 20 final structures, calculated using 693 nuclear Overhauser effects, which display a backbone root-mean square deviation versus the average of 0.25 Å for the well defined region. The structure consists of three α helices and a helical turn. The zinc is coordinated with His 12 via the Nϵ2 atom, with His 16 via the N δ1 atom and with the sulfur atoms of Cys40 and Cys43. The α helices form a three-helix bundle that is stabilized by this zinc-binding unit. The helical arrangement is similar to that found in the DNA-binding domains of the trp repressor, the prd paired domain and Tc3A transposase. Conclusion: The amino-terminal domain of HIV-2 integrase has a remarkable hybrid structure combining features of a three-helix bundle fold with a zinc-binding HHCC motif. This structure shows no similarity with any of the known zinc-finger structures. The strictly conserved residues of the HHCC motif of retroviral integrases are involved in metal coordination, whereas many other well conserved hydrophobic residues are part of the protein core.","tags":[],"title":"The solution structure of the amino-terminal HHCC domain of HIV-2 integrase: a three-helix bundle stabilized by zinc","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas D Tullius"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":820454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603327319,"objectID":"1b6861f0cfc21adde03c9c429590a28a","permalink":"/publication/td-tullius-1996-p-2004/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T00:41:59.676693Z","relpermalink":"/publication/td-tullius-1996-p-2004/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Bioorganic Chemistry: Nucleic Acids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

It is thought that metal binding to CUP2 results in the formation of several looped regions of the protein which then are capable of binding to DNA. CUP2 binds to a site near the CUP1 gene called upstream activation sequence c (UASc), an imperfect inverted repeat. While CUP2 binds to both half-sites of UASc, the upstream half-site appears to be more important for transcriptional activity. A variant of CUP2 called ace1, in which cysteine-11 is replaced by tyrosine, binds to DNA but is incapable of activating transcription. We have used hydroxyl radical footprinting and missing nucleoside analysis to examine the complexes of wild-type CUP2 and the ace1 mutant protein with UASc. Our results indicate that ace1 interacts with a smaller portion of UASc than does CUP2, providing further evidence that the DNA-binding domain of CUP2 is complex, composed of two or more elements that recognize distinct features of UASc. We also show that CUP2 itself binds slightly differently to the two half-sites of UASc. While CUP2 and ace1 bind in a rather similar manner to the downstream half-site, in the upstream half-site CUP2 makes more extensive interactions. Our results suggest that the more crucial role that the upstream half-site plays in transcriptional activation may be due to differences in how CUP2 binds to each of the half-sites of UASc.","tags":[],"title":"CUP2 binds in a bipartite manner to upstream activation sequence c in the promoter of the yeast copper metallothionein gene","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R M Ganunis","Thomas D Tullius","H Guo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":820454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603327320,"objectID":"6f465380864735cdc5a5c57ebadd9a4b","permalink":"/publication/ganunis-1996-p-1701/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T00:42:00.020631Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ganunis-1996-p-1701/","section":"publication","summary":"The hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern of bent DNA containing phased adenine tracts has a sinusoidal pattern.

The recognition helices of these two proteins are almost identical and the DNA sequences they recognize are similar, containing a conserved TAAT core sequence flanked by a somewhat variable sequence. Yet the in vivo functions of the two proteins are quite different. We have used the homeodomains of these two proteins and in vitro selected DNA binding sites to characterize the structural details of homeodomain binding to DNA and to understand the basis for the differences in sequence specificity between homeodomains with similar recognition helices. We have employed hydroxyl radical cleavage of DNA to study the positioning of the proteins on the binding sites and have analyzed the effects of missing nucleosides and purine methylation on homeodomain binding. Our results indicate that the positioning of the Ubx and Dfd homeodomains on their binding sites is consistent with reported structures of other homeodomain/DNA complexes. Dfd and Ubx bind to DNA with the recognition helix in the major groove 3' to the TAAT core sequence and the N-terminal arm in the adjacent minor groove. However, we observe striking differences between the two homeodomains in their specific interactions with DNA. Missing nucleosides within the selected binding sites have differential effects on protein binding, which are dependent on the identity of the homeodomain. Differences at the 3' end of the binding site on the top strand indicate that the N-terminal arm of a homeodomain is capable of distinguishing an A.T base-pair from T.A in the minor groove.

The origins of this discrimination and the proposed role of the side-chain aryl iodide interaction with the helix are addressed. While drug activation with thiols is complex, the rate-limiting rearrangement of the dihydrothiophene intermediate in this process is sufficiently slow for it to serve as the species responsible for the sequence selection common to all reaction pathways leading to DNA cleavage. Internal competition experiments between a TCCT-AGGA sequence, known to be favorable for selective cutting, and a series of other cleavage sites of equal size have been conducted with the dihydrothiophene. Although the extents of reaction differ at the variable four-base pair cassette, the rates of reaction are identical within experimental error. These results indicate that equilibrium binding of the dihydrothiophene is achieved before substantial strand scission has taken place. Therefore, kinetic effects owing, for example, to steric compression to enhance the rate of Bergman cyclization at certain sites do not occur. Sequence selection is govemed by thermodynamic effects favoring binding of the dihydrothiophene at these sequences. Free energy differences relative to the TCCT site can, therefore, be calculated. Knowing this, inosine (I) substitutions for guanosine have been made within the complementary AGGA to give AIGA and AGIA to examine the effect of replacing the 2-amino group of guanosine with the hydrogen of inosine. Analogous competition experiments permit the thermodynamic advantage conferred by aryl iodide interaction with the 5'-guanosine to be estimated as approximately 1 kcaYmo1. The magnitude of this stabilization was compared to the total binding of CLMyl' and CLME at a TCCT-AGGA sequence by isothermal titration calorimetry and quantitative hydroxyl radical footprint titration, respectively, to give an overall view of the energetics of calicheamicin binding to DNA and the role played by the side-chain aryl iodide.","tags":[],"title":"Role of the Aryl Iodide in the Sequence-Selective Cleavage of DNA by Calicheamicin.

The drug binding sites determined in this way were compared to locations of double-stranded DNA cleavage by thiol-activated CLM gamma 1I. The results of these experiments show that CLM epsilon lies in the minor groove in an extended conformation protecting approximately four nucleotides on each strand of DNA. Sites of CLM epsilon binding correlate to sites of CLM gamma 1I cleavage with protection by CLM epsilon occurring mainly to the 3' side of the site of C5' hydrogen abstraction. From these results, it is possible to propose global structures of the drug/DNA complexes such that the oligosaccharide side chain is arrayed to the 3' side of the site of C5' hydrogen abstraction. This conclusion is entirely consistent with the results of recent atom-transfer experiments [Hangeland, J.J., De Voss, J.J., Heath, J.A., Townsend, C.A., Ding, W.-D., Ashcroft, J., \u0026 Ellestad, G.A.

Somewhat greater protection on the strand undergoing C5' hydrogen abstraction was observed to the 5' side of the site of attack owing presumably to proximity of the methyl carbamate portion of the drug with DNA.

In the presence of Cu+ and Ag+) ions its DNA-binding domain is thought to fold as a cysteine-coordinated Cu cluster which recognizes the palindromic CUP1 upstream activation sequence (UASc). Using mobility shift, methylation interference, and DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting assays, we examined the interaction of wild-type and variant CUP2 proteins produced in Escherichia coli with the UASc. Our results suggest that CUP2 has a complex Cu-coordinated DNA-binding domain containing different parts that function as DNA-binding elements recognizing distinct sequence motifs embedded within the UASc. A single-amino-acid substitution of cysteine 11 with a tyrosine results in decreased Cu binding, apparent inactivation of one of the DNA-binding elements and a dramatic change in the recognition properties of CUP2. This variant protein interacts with only one part of the wild-type site and prefers to bind to a different half-site from the wild-type protein. Although the variant has about 10% of wild-type DNA-binding activity, it appears to be completely incapable of activating transcription.","tags":[],"title":"A single amino acid change in CUP2 alters its mode of DNA binding.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qiu Guo","M Lu","Mair Churchill","Thomas D Tullius","N Kallenbach"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":631152000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603327323,"objectID":"87aecccbb35400de2c4152d4582f8f01","permalink":"/publication/guo-1990-p-338/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T00:42:03.607584Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guo-1990-p-338/","section":"publication","summary":"We present here experimental evidence that three-arm branched DNA molecules form an asymmetric structure in the presence of Mg2+. Electrophoretic mobility and chemical and enzymatic footprinting experiments on a three-arm branched DNA molecule formed from three 16-mer strands are described. The electrophoretic mobilities of three species of a three-arm junction in which pairs of arms are extended are found to differ in the presence of Mg2+: one combination of elongated arms migrates significantly faster than the other two. This effect is eliminated in the absence of Mg2+, leading us to suggest that the three-arm DNA junction forms an asymmetric structure due to preferential stacking of two of the arms at the junction in the presence of Mg2+. The pattern of self-protection of each 16-mer strand of the core complex exposed to Fe(II).EDTA and DNase I scission is unique, consistent with formation of an asymmetric structure in the presence of Mg2+.

We find concentration-dependent changes in the locations of distamycin binding sites on the somatic 5S gene of Xenopus borealis.

The missing nucleoside experiment can be used to scan a DNA molecule at single-nucleotide resolution in one experiment. The bacteriophage lambda repressor-OR1 and cro-OR1 complexes were analyzed to evaluate the method. For both proteins, the most important contacts are located in the protein monomer that binds to the consensus half of the operator. These contacts correspond well to those found by mutational studies, and in the cocrystal structure of the lambda repressor-operator. The missing nucleoside data show that the amino-terminal arms of lambda repressor make energetically important contacts with positions 7 and 8 and the central dyad base pair of the operator. The amino-terminal arm that makes the most extensive contacts to DNA appears to be the one that emanates from the repressor monomer that binds to the consensus half of the operator, in agreement with the cocrystal structure.

The hydroxyl radical abstracts a deoxyribose hydrogen atom, cleaving one strand of the DNA. The cutting pattern, visualized by separating the cleavage products using gel electrophoresis, shows the reactivity of each backbone position toward the radical. This method has been applied to studies of DNA bending and helical twist. Phased runs of adenines (adenine tracts) cause sequence-directed DNA bending. The hydroxyl radical cleavage of a bent DNA fragment containing short adenine tracts phased with the helix screw gives rise to an unusual cutting pattern. The hydroxyl radical cleavage rate decreases in the 5' to 3' direction along each adenine tract, with a minimum at the 3' end of each adenine tract. The cleavage of the matching thymine tract is similar, but the minimum in the pattern is offset in the 3' direction. This pattern on the autoradiograph of the gel is interpreted to indicate that bending is accompanied by a narrow minor groove in the DNA molecule. Furthermore, hydroxyl radical cleavage results in different cutting patterns for two similar sequences, (CGA4T4)5 and (CGT4A4)5, which have been shown to be bent and relatively straight, respectively. The hydroxyl radical method has also been used to determine the helical repeat of the metallothionein IIA gene to be about 10.5 base pairs per turn.

This is achieved by minimizing the sequence symmetry in the flanking arms, so that base pairs lock at the branch site. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and analysis of two semimobile junctions, structures in which a controlled extent of branch point migratory freedom is deliberately introduced. We have constructed two minimally symmetric four-arm semimobile junctions from synthetic deoxy 17-mers. These junctions, termed \\\"monomobile\\\", contain a single pair of base pairs (A-T or C-G) which can migrate at the site of branching, while the rest of the junction is immobile. We have demonstrated by gel electrophoresis techniques that these junctions form and that they have the predicted 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry. We have compared these junctions with the immobile junction on which they are based, by means of hydroxyl radical protection experiments. From these data, both migratory conformers can be seen to coexist in solution. The semimobile junction with the C-G base pair has the same crossover and stacking pattern observed for the immobile junction, while the junction with the A-T base pair has the opposite pattern. We conclude that crossover and stacking patterns are a direct consequence of the base pairs which flank the junction. In addition, the data indicate that the crossover pattern biases for these junctions are much greater than are the migratory biases.","tags":[],"title":"Construction and analysis of monomobile DNA junctions.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

The most widely used experimental test for bending relies on the observation that bent DNA migrates more slowly than straight DNA on a polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. It was shown recently that the polymer (GTTTTAAAAC)n runs with normal mobility on a gel, whereas (GAAAATTTTC)n runs more slowly and thus appears to be strongly bent. The observation that these similar sequences, which differ only in the order of the adenine and thymine tracts, adopt such different shapes offers a stringent test of theories to explain DNA bending. Although the wedge model for DNA bending has recently been elaborated to explain the gel mobilities of these molecules, we wished to determine experimentally the structural basis for the difference in bending. We report here measurements of the frequency of cleavage by the hydroxyl radical at each nucleotide of cloned versions of the two polymers (see Fig. 1). We show that the TTTTAAAA sequence does not display the cleavage pattern that is associated with bent DNA, whereas the AAAATTTT sequence does. The observed sequence dependence of the cleavage pattern of an adenine tract is at odds with current models for DNA bending, which assume that adenine tracts always adopt the same conformation.","tags":[],"title":"Structural details of an adenine tract that does not cause DNA to bend","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas D Tullius","Amanda Burkhoff","W K Olson","W Olson","M Sarma","R Sarma","M Sundaralingam"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":567993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603327327,"objectID":"fc1de001100e62c03fa2faa5b30d42ad","permalink":"/publication/tullius-1988-p-1239/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T00:42:06.981944Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tullius-1988-p-1239/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Using the chemistry of the hydroxyl radical to determine structural details of bent DNA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas D.

Several batches of bacteria were grown, and one sample of isolated and purified selenoazurin (azurin in which methionine was substituted by selenomethionine) was found (by neutron activation analysis) to contain 5.2 +/- 0.8 seleniums/copper. Correspondingly, a residual 0.35 methionines, relative to 6.0 in the native protein, were found by amino acid analysis in this azurin sample. The redox potential and extinction coefficient of this selenoazurin were found to be 333 +/- 1 mV (pH 7.0, I = 0.22) and 5855 +/- 160 M-1 cm-1 at 626 +/- 1 nm, respectively. Visible electronic, CD, and EPR spectra are reported and Gaussian curve fitting to the former spectrum allowed assignment of the selenomethionine Se----Cu(II) transition to a band found at 18034 cm-1, based upon an observed 450 cm-1 shift to the red from the analogous band position in the native protein. The data are consistent with a relatively more covalent copper site stabilizing the reduced, Cu(I), form in the selenoprotein.
